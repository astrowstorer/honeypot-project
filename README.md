# honeypot-project #
Project Overview:<br />
Created and deployed a VM via Azure, exposed the machine as a honeypot example, and monitored resulting traffic in Microsoft Sentinel.

--- 

Here's an overview of the setup of the VM, running Windows 10, in Azure. After deploying the machine, I created a custom NIC configuration to expose it and allow all traffic. Then, I created a Log Analytics Workspace and linked it to the VM, with Microsoft Defender for Cloud configured to store all security events via Event Viewer.<br /><br />

After connecting to the VM via Windows Remote Desktop and configuring basic controls, I inspected the security logs as a baseline.<br /><br />

Trying to ping the VM from my personal machine to establish external traffic was constantly timing outâ€¦<br /><br />

To allow traffic, I disabled all firewall controls...<br /><br />

I implemented a custom PowerShell script (from: [source](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab/blob/main/Custom_Security_Log_Exporter.ps1)) with an integrated IP geolocation API to collect data from failed RDP login attempts. I was hoping these attempts would start coming in over the next few hours now that the machine was exposed to the internet.<br /><br />

The PowerShell script contains some sample outputs for training field detection in Microsoft Sentinel, but I tested it with some intentionally failed attempts from my own machine to demonstrate malicious logins.

I ingested the log data from the PowerShell script into Azure as a new table in the LAW and used that to create a new workbook in Sentinel, allowing me to visualize the data as a dashboard map. Surprisingly, in the few hours I left this project live until the next morning, no other failed RDP login attempts came in, but I decided to take it down after it served its purpose.<br /><br />

Here's a look at the visualization of the data in Sentinel, excluding the training data but including my own simulated malicious failed login attempts via RDP.
